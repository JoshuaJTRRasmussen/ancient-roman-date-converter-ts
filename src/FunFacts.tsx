      <h2>Fun Facts about the Roman Calendar</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Ancient Roman calendar counted inclusively up to the three marker
          days in each month: the <em>Kalends, Nones,</em> and <em>Ides</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em>Kalends</em> always fell on the first of the month
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em>Nones</em> fell on the 5th or 7th depending on the month
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em>Ides</em> fell on the 13th or 15th depending on the month
        </li>
        <li>
          March 13, for example, would be considered &quot;3 days before the
          Ides of March,&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          March 14 would be called &quot;the day before the Ides of March.&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          Since the next marker day after the <em>Ides</em> was the{" "}
          <em>Kalends,</em> any day falling after the <em>Ides</em> would count
          down to the <em>Kalends</em> of the next month, so that, for example,
          the date we call March 16 would have been called &quot;17 days before
          the Kalends of April&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          Years were typically named for the two consuls of that year, so the
          year we call 59 B.C.E. would have been referred to as{" "}
          <em>Caesare et Bibulo consulibus,</em> or, &quot;in the consulship of
          Caesar and Bibulus&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          Ancient historians such as Varro eventually began referring to years
          in relation to the founding of Rome, a year we call 753 B.C.E.
